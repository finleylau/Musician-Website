    switched to container-fluid
    
    updated register.html
    implemented register
    
    implemented navigation bar
    ****** need to go back through and change URL routes!
    
    Implementing Biography:
        created biography table in tables.db
        set up biography route in application.py
        created editBio.html
        implemented "GET" request method
        
        finished implementing bio
        formatted bio using line spacing
        
        -- not the best user experience (have to retype the entire bio every time you edit it) --
        -- try to enable the existing bio to already appear within the text box
        
        added cancel button to edit page
    
    Implementing Rep List:
        created table for replist
        table - issue with formatting (goes off the side of screen (need to make the form inputs smaller)
        need to implement the replist route in application.py
        
        finished implementing rep list
        
        -- not the best user experience (unable to edit or delete elements once you make them -> MUST ADD)
        -- Search/sort capabilities (sort on different fields from the user's point of view)
    
    
    -- NEXT STEPS --
    -> implement Events (Google Calendar API?)
    -> implement Home with some sort of quick access to add rep or events
        -> display a calendar
            -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/38201158
        -> display a small vertical form to add rep
        -> display personal information
            -> profile picture, name, education, primary instrument, secondary instrument, etc.
            -> possibly a new route in between register and index

    Implement Events:
        read Google Calendar API Documentation
        
        -> EVENTS CALENDAR TOO COMPLICATED FOR NOW
    
    Implement Homepage:
        read about file uploads (for profile picture)
        need to create a new route in between register and homepage
        
        read Flask-Uploads -> http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Uploads/
        
        created personalinfo route in application.py -> NOT IMPLEMENTED
        created personalInfo.html -> NOT UPDATED

August 15
    Implementing Homepage:
        configured Flask-Uploads in top of code but did NOT make the route
        
        updated personal info template
        added uploads route to application.py
        NEED TO CREATE PERSONAL INFO TABLE (see CS50 Final Project Table)
        
        implemented uploads and personal info without inserting into database -> need to handle FIRST-TIME USERS and EDITING
        
        -- WHEN CREATING INDEX - maybe have a placeholder image in case profile picture is left blank
        
        got upload working - figure out how to customize the filename to make sorting easier
        
        
        -- NOTES ON UPLOAD --
        user can now upload files and they will be renamed to user# where # is the user_id
        currently, no feature to edit the pictures - make different template for editing (largely the same, but the actions are different)
        
        -- NEXT STEPS --
        implement personal info table
        finish implementing personal info
        create homepage for user
        create edit page for upload
        
        for whole site: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7865695/how-do-i-create-the-small-icon-next-to-the-website-tab-for-my-site
        
        created index.html/updated with values
        need to finish updating personal info database and then finish implementing index route
        
        finished implementing index route
        
        -- LAST STEPS -- 
        better user experience for editing bio and replist
        overwrite files to not take up a ton of space - DONE
        updated UX for bio
        
        need to add delete feature to replist
