# musician-website

-- Synopsis --

This web app serves as a personal portfolio website for musicians.  The "profile" home page includes a profile picture and some
personal information, all provided at the time of registration.  This information can be edited by following links on the home page.
The biography feature allows a user to type or paste in their own bio, and edit it later if they so choose.  The repertoire list feature
allows users to input the repertoire that they've played, along with key attributes such as the piece composer, when the piece was played, etc.


-- Motivation -- 

This project was originally created for the CS50x Introduction to Computer Science Final Project.  A secondary purpose was to serve as
a helpful tool for me (Percussion Performance Major at Northwestern University) and my fellow musicians.
